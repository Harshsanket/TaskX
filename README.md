# Todo List App

The Todo List App is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage their daily tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks as needed.

## Learning Objectives

This project serves as a learning exercise to gain proficiency in building React applications and managing application state. The key learning objectives include:

- Understanding and implementing React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Managing application state using React hooks.
- Integrating form submissions and handling user input.
- Deploying React applications using Vercel.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the todo list by entering the task description in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkbox next to each task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks from the todo list by clicking the delete button next to each task.
- **Persistent Data**: The todo list data is stored locally using `localStorage`, allowing users to access their tasks even after refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used

The Todo List App is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: The frontend is developed using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **ShadcnUI**: ShadcnUI is used as the UI library for components, providing pre-styled components for rapid UI development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for additional styling, providing utility classes for customizing the UI.
- **Vercel**: The app is deployed and hosted on Vercel, offering seamless deployment and hosting capabilities.
- **Custom Hooks**: Custom React hooks are used for managing application state and handling side effects.
